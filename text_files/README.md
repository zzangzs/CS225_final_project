# yuli9-yixiaof2-nankang2-zisuj2
Final project for team: dhrev
## Github Organization
### /proj
All the code stores in proj.
Airport.h/cpp & Route.h/cpp - contain two classes - Airport and Route.
Graph.h/cpp - contain 3 algorithms (BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm and Pagerank) and graph visualization.
Readfile.h/cpp - used to parse the dataset
main.cpp - run all the algorithms and show their output
test.cpp - test the visualization on world map

Most of tests are stored in /proj/tests, apart from Dij_test_big and Dij_test_small which we used to test our Dijkstra's algorithm during development, and test.cpp which is used to debug visualization.

### /proj/tests
Contain all test cases for data parsing and test datasets for those test cases.

### /proj/data
Contain the full scale dataset that we will use in main.cpp

### /proj/IMG
Contain images that will be shown in .md files on github.

### /proj/text_files
All text documents apart from dataset will be stored here. Contains our log, final presentation link, README.md, result.md,proposal, and team contract.
