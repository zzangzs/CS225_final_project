# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**  Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 6:30-9:00 PM in the Lounge room of  Presby Hall. Each member will rotate taking notes in a Google Doc, starting with zisuj2. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly Development Log in another Google Doc by the end of Friday, which then be pushed to the team repo after approval by everyone no later than 8:00 pm that Sunday.

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through WeChat Group chat in real time. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to the group chat within 2 hours. Team members are also willing to have face-to-face conversations for emergencies.

3. **Respect** During the weekly team meeting, the note-taker will serve as the leader of the meeting. The note-taker own the authority to decide which team member to propose his/her opinion or ideas at the moment, and other members should not interrupt the presenter. Whenever the team arrives at the point to make a decision, a vote may be executed to reach an agreement. The decision will be made if most of the members do not dissent. Member(s) holding disagreement should submit to the final resolution. 
 

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** 
We will assign work during weekly meeting. Everyone will be assigned a part of work through discussion and can volunteer to work on one or more deliverables if he/she has extra time. Adjustment will be considered if the workload is unbalanced.

2. **Time Commitment** 
In our group, each member is expected to commit 3-6 hours per week on the project excluding the group meeting time. Our group meeting is expected to last for 3 and half hours, and we will be discussing the difficulties and unexpected circumstances we encountered during this week. If one of our group members is having difficulties finishing his/her assigned task for the upcoming week, we will work together to decide the time commitment based on the conditions. It’s the group’s responsibility to keep track of the time and make sure every task is finished before the deadline. 

3. **Conflict Resolution** 
All conflicts within the team will be decided by voting(~~and fighting~~).
