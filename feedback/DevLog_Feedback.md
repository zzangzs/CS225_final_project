# Development Log Feedback


## Week of 3/28 - 4/3


### Grade
Pass

### Comments:
Your group has made solid progress in the past week and seems on track, no real concerns. I really like that your development log is extremely detailed, but do not feel pressured to give this much information every week (unless you would prefer to, of course). 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/concerns about the project.
