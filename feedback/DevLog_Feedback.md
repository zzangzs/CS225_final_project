# Development Log Feedback


## Week of 3/28 - 4/3


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
Your group has made solid progress in the past week and seems on track, no real concerns. I really like that your development log is extremely detailed, but do not feel pressured to give this much information every week (unless you would prefer to, of course). 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/concerns about the project.

## Week of 4/4 - 4/10


### Grade
Missing log update

### Comments:
Your group has not updated the development log for this week.
