# Development Log Feedback


## Week of 3/28 - 4/3


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
Your group has made solid progress in the past week and seems on track, no real concerns. I really like that your development log is extremely detailed, but do not feel pressured to give this much information every week (unless you would prefer to, of course). 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/concerns about the project.

Initially was missing a log submission for this week, but it was updated later. It looks like your group is still making consistent progress despite the bugs, which is good. I'm not sure if I understand your issue regarding the "usability of BFS". Are you not sure about how BFS will be used in your final project program? If so, it's fine if you don't use BFS in determining the shortest path or the most important airports, as BFS is really only needed to satisfy the traversal requirement. In your case, BFS actually will output the shortest path between two airports in terms of the number of intermediate airport stops (i.e. it will try to find the path which visits the least number of airports). So this is something you could write about in your final report, or something you could add to your leading question.

It seems that your group has made considerable progress so far, so great work on that. I think you'll find that if you have BFS implemented, then Dijkstra's algorithm will end up being very structurally similar to BFS. Looking forward to meeting with your group for the check-in.

Your progress for this week is quite good, and I think you shouldn't run into any issues completing the project on time. Great work!
